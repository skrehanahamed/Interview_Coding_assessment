Interview Coding Assessment Repository
Welcome to my Interview Coding Assessment repository! Here, you'll find a collection of coding questions encountered during technical interviews, along with their solutions. Most of the code is written in C/C++. 
The purpose of this repository is to help others prepare for interviews, showcase problem-solving skills, and foster collaboration. Contributions are welcome!
